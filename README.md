<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![https://discord-clone-652ad.firebaseapp.com/](https://github.com/p1yu5h0/discord/blob/main/Discord.png)

This is my personal project called Discord 2.0 in which I tried to learn various web technologies by making this project. 

It took me around 2 weeks to complete this simple version of Discord in which I have added basic features like real time chatting with the help of firebase, making channels in which my friends can come and chat with each other.
